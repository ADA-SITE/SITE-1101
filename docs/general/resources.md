# Policies & Resources

ADA University has her university-wide [policy documents](https://www.ada.edu.az/en/academics/policies). You are expected to carefully study at least the following short documents: [Honor Code](https://www.ada.edu.az/file_upload/policies/honor_code.pdf) and [Student Code of Conduct](https://www.ada.edu.az/file_upload/policies/student_code_conduct.pdf). You should also be aware of the [Student Assessment Regulations](https://www.ada.edu.az/file_upload/policies/stud_as_reg.pdf). If you have strong reasons to disagree with the grade you got, you should follow the procedures written in [Student Academic Grievance Policy](https://www.ada.edu.az/file_upload/policies/stud_acad_griev_policy.pdf). 

Students with **special needs** or with **chronic health issues** are strongly recommended to contact the University’s [Student Academic Support Services](https://www.ada.edu.az/en/experience/sass). ADA University provides upon request appropriate academic accommodations for qualified students with documented disabilities. Any student who feels (s)he may need accommodation based on the impact of a disability should notify the Office of Disability Services and Inclusive Education about their needs before the start of the academic term.[^1]

Adjusting to student life, pursuing academic and personal goals can be emotionally stressful and challenging. Students are encouraged to make individual appointments with a Counselor to receive professional **psychological support**.

Students are encouraged to consult with the Writing Center for checking their papers and assignments. Please visit the center or contact them by email. Reasonable accommodation is possible for students’ religious beliefs, observations, and practices or for foreseeable conflicts because of athletic competition. Students with recurring or permanent internet and/or hardware problems are strongly recommended to contact the University’s IT Service Desk and/or the Blackboard Administrator.
